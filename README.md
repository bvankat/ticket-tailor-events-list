# Ticket Tailor Events List for Wordpress
This Wordpress plugin pulls event data from (Ticket Tailor API[https://developers.tickettailor.com]) and displays it on the page via shortcode.

## Background ##
Ticket Tailor's default embed codes are pretty lacking. A client using Ticket Tailor's box office wanted to show their upcoming events on their website and include with each event:
- Event image
- Event title
- Event description
- Event date and time
- Button to purchase tickets via the box office

## Usage ##
1. Install the plugin
2. Enter your Ticket Tailor API key in Settings > Ticket Tailor
3. Insert the [ show_events ] shortcode wherever you'd like the shows to appear.

## Styling ##
Events are listed in a card-style flexbox grid. The plugin's style.css file can be adjusted as needed.
